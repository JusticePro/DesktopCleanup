# Desktop Cleanup <i>"Utility"</i>

<h1>What does it do?</h1>
Desktop Cleanup Utility (If you want you can call it "DCU") is an application I created to quickly and simply clean and organize my files on my desktop.<br>
<br>
A folder will be created called "Master Folder".<br>
For each file on the desktop a folder will be created (if the folder does not exist) in "Master Folder".<br>
It will be named the file type of the file.<br>
Folders will be moved into a folder called ".folders" in "Master Folder".<br>
<h1>How do I use it?</h1>
This application is very simple to use. When you open it there is a window with a button that is called "Clean UP".<br>
Press the clean up button. Done!<br
